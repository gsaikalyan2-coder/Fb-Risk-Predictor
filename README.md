 ⚽ Football Injury Risk Prediction Model

 📌 Overview
 
This project predicts **football player injury risk** (Low, Medium, High) using a ruthless classification pipeline, balanced dataset, and a TensorFlow neural network.  
It features a **Gradio dashboard** with tabs for single player prediction, player comparison, and interactive graphs.

🚀 Features

- Single Player Tab → Risk level, info card, probability breakdown, prediction history
- Compare Two Players Tab → Side‑by‑side risk comparison, probability graph, breakdown percentages
- Graphs Tab → Interactive visualizations:
  - Risk distribution pie chart
  - Age vs Risk boxplot
  - FIFA rating vs Risk bar chart
  - Team risk stacked bar chart
  - Performance drop scatter plot

🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit‑learn (preprocessing, balancing)
- TensorFlow/Keras (model training)
- Matplotlib (visualizations)
- Gradio (interactive dashboard)

📊 Dataset
The dataset includes player attributes, FIFA ratings, match ratings before/after injury, and recovery timelines.
